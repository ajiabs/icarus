              THIS AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN SECTION XV THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ALL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THE ARBITRATION PROVISION REQUIRES THAT DISPUTES BE RESOLVED IN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT PROCEEDINGS.

                    <h1>SUBSCRIPTIONS, CHARGES AND FEES</h1>
                    <p>
                       <b>Paid Subscriptions.</b> You agree to pay all charges associated with the Products and Services, including but not limited to, activation, monthly service, payment processing fees, standard text messaging fees, your internet service provider’s fees, applicable federal, state, and local taxes and fees (if any), fees to recoup any municipal, state and federal fees or assessments on us, as well as any government imposed fees or taxes, whether imposed upon you or <em>iNetDown</em>, that become applicable retroactively.  <em>iNetDown</em> will provide you with notice of applicable pricing contemporaneous with your account activation.  We will also provide you with notification of any changes to our prices or fees; provided, however, that <em>iNetDown</em> may elect not to provide notice except where required by law of changes in fees that are occasioned as a result of changes to government taxes, fees or assessments.  

                       <br><br>
                       When you first set up your account, you may enroll in one or more of several different monthly and/or annual subscription plans, which will continue until you cancel your subscription. These subscription plans entitle you to access your <em>iNetDown</em> account, Product and/or Services for each payment period until such subscription is cancelled. Your paid subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the installation of an <em>iNetDown</em> Product and continue on a monthly or annual basis depending on your election when you first set up your Product. By submitting your payment details in conjunction with opening your account, you agree to this charge. To avoid this charge, you must cancel your <em>iNetDown</em> subscription by discontinuing the it via the <em>iNetDown</em> website. Prior to the start of the next annual or monthly subscription period. Subscription fees are billed or charged on the first day of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, <em>iNetDown</em> reserves the right to cancel your <em>iNetDown</em> subscription and to collect any rejection or insufficient funds fee and to process any such payment by the payment method you have submitted to us.

                       <br><br>
                       <b>Auto-Renewal of Paid Subscriptions.</b> Unless you cancel your subscription as set forth above, any paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current rate. To change or discontinue your paid Services at any time, go to account settings or contact us. If you terminate a paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period, except as set forth in the Refund Policy below. Your non-termination or continued use of a paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your payment method for that paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for all such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the paid Service.

                  <p>
                      PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

                      <br><br>
                      YOU AND <em>iNetDown</em> AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND OR PRODUCTS, TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO THE CONTENT, ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court in your county of residence within the United States if your claims qualify; and (2) this agreement to arbitrate does not include your or <em>iNetDown’s</em> right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court in Illinois to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

                      There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.

You agree that any such arbitration award against <em>iNetDown</em> shall be limited as set forth above.

                      <h2>Dispute Notice</h2>
                          <p>
                        Before initiating an arbitration, you and <em>iNetDown</em> each agree to first provide the other a written notice (“Notice of Dispute”), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. A Notice of Dispute should be emailed to Admin@inetdown.com. We will provide a Notice of Dispute to you via the email address associated with your <em>iNetDown</em> account. You and <em>iNetDown</em> agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration and not to commence an arbitration proceeding until a forty-five (45) day post-notice resolution period expires.
                      </p>

                      <h3>*Arbitration Process and Procedure *</h3>
                      <p>
                          If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within forty-five (45) days from the original Dispute Notice, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to these terms. Arbitration shall (1) be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect (the “JAMS Rules”) and as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules regarding filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator fees; (2) be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator; and (3) take place in the county where you reside or any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the “Minimum Standards”), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.

                          <br><br>
                          WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. Further, unless both you and <em>iNetDown</em> expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.

                          <br><br>
                          If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right to a jury trial.

                      <br><br>
                      YOU THEREFORE UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND <em>iNetDown</em> ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

                      <br><br>
                      The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

                      <br><br>
                      The JAMS Rules are available on its website at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. Notwithstanding any JAMS Rules to the contrary or any other provision in the arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern, you and <em>iNetDown</em> each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide. Further, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. Subject to the limitations of liability set forth above, the arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                      </p>

                      <br><br>

                      <h2>Hearing</h2>

                      <p>
                        If your claim does not exceed $10,000 (USD), you and <em>iNetDown</em> agree to waive an oral hearing by the arbitrator and the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and <em>iNetDown</em> submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. To the extent an oral hearing is requested by you or <em>iNetDown</em>, or deemed necessary by the arbitrator, you and <em>iNetDown</em> agree that the hearing will be conducted telephonically or videographicaLly.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Arbitrator’s Decision</h2>
                      <p>
                          An arbitrator’s award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award. The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                      </p>

                      <h3>*Fees *</h3>
                      <p>
                          It is each parties’ responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, case management/administrative, and arbitrator fees as set forth in the JAMS Rules. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, <em>iNetDown</em> will pay the additional cost. If your claim for damages does not exceed $5,000 (USD) and you follow the dispute notice procedure set forth above, <em>iNetDown</em> will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Dispute or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
                      </p>

                      <h3>*Small Claims & Government Actions *</h3>

                      <p>
                          As an alternative to arbitration, you or <em>iNetDown</em> may resolve Disputes in a small claims court that has jurisdiction over your claim. These Terms and this arbitration agreement do not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against <em>iNetDown</em> on your behalf.
                      </p>

                      <h2>One Year Limitation Period.</h2>
