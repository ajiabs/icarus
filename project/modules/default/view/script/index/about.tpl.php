                            <em>iNetDown</em> is a subscription service utilizing a plug-in module (easily installed to your internet/TV service provider’s modem designed to monitor internet/TV) designed to monitor internet/TV
connectivity as well as the existence of a power supply to the modem. The module continuously
communicates with <em>iNetDown’s</em> servers such that an interruption in that communication
chain alerts <em>iNetDown</em> to the fact that your power may be out, or you may be experiencing
internet connectivity outages for other reasons. Within 5 minutes of a loss of power or
connectivity, <em>iNetDown</em> is able to alert you via text message and/or email of power and/or
internet outages.
                            <br><br>

                            <em>iNetDown</em> is cost effective. You are not required to purchase or lease any equipment from
<em>iNetDown</em>, and <em>iNetDown’s</em> monthly subscription fees are extremely low compared to other
home monitoring services. in fact, it’s likely that your agreement with your internet enabled
cable/dish/other TV programing provider obligates the provider to credit your account for certain
service outages, and such credits are also required by the laws of many jurisdictions. To obtain
such credits, however, you are usually required to notify the service provider of outages and to
request the reimbursements to which you are legally entitled, and you must do so within
specified periods of time or lose your rights! <em>iNetDown</em> can notify your service provider
immediately when you are experiencing an outage, can monitor the length of the service outage,
and can process on your behalf requests for the credits to which you may be entitled. This
feature alone could actually result in credits from your service provider that exceed the average
monthly cost of your <em>iNetDown</em> subscription. Thus, <em>iNetDown</em> could pay for itself!


                          <br><br>

                          <em>iNetDown’s</em> power monitoring feature enables us to notify you of the possibility that critical
components of your home such as sump pumps, internet-based alarm systems, gas furnaces,
refrigerators, internet monitored home medical devices, and others, are not receiving power. By
receiving notice of such an outage within 5 minutes of its of its occurrence, you may
immediately start taking remedial measures to help avoid serious problems. For example, your
sump pump may have a backup battery giving you a false sense of security that your basement is
flood-proof even in the event of a power outage. But the fact is that backup batteries for sump
pumps only have approximately a life of 5 to 5.5 hours of continual usage. As a result, a storm
could trigger an early morning power outage causing your backup battery to run out of power
before you even return home from work, potentially resulting in a flooded basement. Similarly,
a power outage will cause a gas furnace to cease functioning, and water pipes can freeze and
burst in a matter of just a few hours. Imagine coming home from work to find your power out
and water gushing from a pipe that burst from freezing or, worse yet, coming home from a
vacation to the damage caused by water that has been gushing for days or weeks! With
<em>iNetDown</em>, even while on vacation, you could receive an email and/or text message notifying
you of a power outage within moments of its occurrence, so you can stave off a disaster.
                            <br><br>

                            <em>iNetDown</em> also gives you the ability to have alerts sent to multiple people. Do you have elderly
parents, relatives, or friends living alone who are especially susceptible to the potential dangers
of a power outage, such as being exposed to sweltering heat if their air conditioning is disabled?
Your <em>iNetDown</em> plan provides the flexibility for you and multiple other family members and/or friends to be immediately alerted the moment your loved ones lose power, so steps can be
taken to avoid potentially disastrous consequences.
                            
                            <br><br>

                            With respect to a loss of internet connectivity, <em>iNetDown</em> differentiates between internet
outages resulting from a loss of power and internet outages resulting from loss of service and/or
malfunctioning equipment. <em>iNetDown</em> then alerts you as to which problem is the source of the
loss of connectivity. And, in the event of a power outage, <em>iNetDown</em> can even enable you to
receive continued internet connectivity designed to last at least the duration of an average power
outage. What <em>iNetDown</em> does not do, however, is employ the use of cookies, or otherwise
monitor your internet searches, uses or preferences.
